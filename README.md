We research this because real rooms make audio sound bad (echo, reverb, distortion). By studying a room’s Impulse Response, we can understand how it affects sound, remove unwanted effects, or recreate them. It uses key Signals & Systems concepts like convolution, deconvolution, and LTI systems, and it solves real audio problems in music, film, podcasts, and games.
